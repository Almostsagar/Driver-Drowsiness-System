# Driver-Drowsiness-System
The basic purpose of the system is to identify the driverâ€™s facial condition &amp; if the driver is feeling drowsy , then system will trigger a warming output in the form of alarm. For incoming live video stream, a frame is extracted for processing.

## Libraries:
- Numpy: Prerequisite for Dlib
- Scipy: Used for calculating Euclidean distance between facial landmark point in the eye ratio.
- Pygame
- Dlib: Dlib library is used  to detect & localize facial landmark.
- Imutils: Imutils are a series of convenience function to make basic image processing function such as translation, rotation, resizing & displaying matplotlib image easier with opencv.
- Opencv: Used to get the video stream from the webcam.
